# Introduction

Welcome to the MyCoder documentation! This guide will help you get started with MyCoder, an AI-powered coding assistant that helps you accomplish a wide range of coding tasks through natural language commands.

## What is MyCoder?

MyCoder is a command-line tool that uses AI to help you with software development tasks. By understanding your project's structure and requirements, MyCoder can autonomously execute complex coding tasks that would typically require significant manual effort.

Currently available as a research preview, MyCoder is built to work alongside developers, enhancing productivity while maintaining full control over the development process.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered**: Supports multiple AI providers including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Ollama
- **Extensible Tool System**: Includes tools for file operations, shell commands, web browsing, and more
- **Parallel Execution**: Can spawn sub-agents to work on different parts of a task simultaneously
- **Self-Modification**: Capable of modifying code, including its own codebase
- **Smart Logging**: Hierarchical, color-coded logging for clear visibility into actions
- **Human-Compatible**: Works with standard project structures without special formatting
- **Configuration System**: Persistent configuration options to customize behavior
- **GitHub Integration**: Optional GitHub mode for working with issues and PRs
- **Custom Prompts**: Ability to customize the system prompt for specialized behavior

## How MyCoder Works

MyCoder operates by:

1. **Understanding your request**: Processing your natural language prompt to understand what you want to accomplish
2. **Analyzing your codebase**: Examining your project structure, files, and dependencies
3. **Planning the approach**: Breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps
4. **Executing the plan**: Using its tool system to make changes, run commands, and verify results
5. **Reporting back**: Providing clear explanations of what was done and any issues encountered

## Use Cases

MyCoder can help with a wide variety of development tasks:

- **Feature Implementation**: Add new features to your codebase
- **Bug Fixing**: Diagnose and fix issues in your code
- **Refactoring**: Improve code structure and organization
- **Testing**: Create and improve test coverage
- **Setup and Configuration**: Configure tools, libraries, and development environments
- **Documentation**: Generate and improve code documentation
- **Research**: Find and apply solutions from documentation or online resources
