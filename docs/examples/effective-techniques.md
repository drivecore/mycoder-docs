This page outlines these techniques to help you craft better prompts for your own projects.\n\n## Using GitHub as External Memory\n\nOne of the most powerful techniques is using GitHub as a persistent external memory store for your project. This approach provides several benefits:\n\n### Why This Works\n\n- **Maintains Context:** GitHub issues, PRs, and commits create a persistent record that MyCoder can reference\n- **Tracks Evolution:** Changes over time are documented and accessible\n- **Structures Work:** Breaking work into issues and PRs creates natural task boundaries\n- **Enables Collaboration:** Both humans and MyCoder can reference and build upon the same information\n\n### Implementation Techniques\n\n1. **Create Issues for Tasks:** Break work into discrete issues that MyCoder can reference by number\n2. **Reference Issue Numbers:** Use `#issue-number` in your prompts to give MyCoder context\n3. **Link Related Work:** Reference previous PRs or issues when asking for related work\n4. **Document Decisions:** Use issue comments to record decisions and rationale\n\n## Clear Task Definition\n\nClearly defining tasks helps MyCoder understand exactly what you need.\n\n### Why This Works\n\n- **Reduces Ambiguity:** Explicit instructions minimize misunderstandings\n- **Sets Expectations:** Clear deliverables help MyCoder know when it's done\n- **Provides Context:** Background information helps MyCoder make better decisions\n\n### Implementation Techniques\n\n1. **Specify Deliverables:** Clearly state what you expect (e.g., \"create a GitHub issue and PR\")\n2. **Provide Rationale:** Explain why you want something done a certain way\n3. **Set Boundaries:** Define what's in scope and out of scope\n4. **Reference Examples:** Point to existing code or documentation as examples\n\n## Breaking Down Complex Tasks\n\nComplex tasks are more manageable when broken into smaller pieces.\n\n### Why This Works\n\n- **Simplifies Implementation:** Smaller tasks are easier to understand and implement\n- **Enables Verification:** You can verify each piece before moving to the next\n- **Improves Quality:** Focused work typically results in better quality\n\n### Implementation Techniques\n\n1. **Create Multiple Issues:** Break large features into multiple GitHub issues\n2. **Implement Incrementally:** Ask MyCoder to implement one piece at a time\n3. **Verify Incrementally:** Check each implementation before moving forward\n4. **Build Complexity Gradually:** Start with core functionality, then add refinements\n\n## Providing References and Examples\n\nPointing MyCoder to existing code or documentation helps it understand your preferred approach.\n\n### Why This Works\n\n- **Maintains Consistency:** References help ensure new code matches existing patterns\n- **Reduces Explanation Needed:** Examples often communicate better than descriptions\n- **Leverages Existing Knowledge:** MyCoder can adapt patterns it sees in your codebase\n\n### Implementation Techniques\n\n1. **Reference Similar Code:** Point to similar implementations in your codebase\n2. **Provide File Paths:** Be specific about where to find reference implementations\n3. **Highlight Key Patterns:** Call attention to specific aspects of the examples\n4. **Cross-Repository References:** Reference patterns from other repositories when applicable\n\n## Iterative Refinement\n\nIterative feedback and refinement often leads to better results than trying to get everything perfect in one go.\n\n### Why This Works\n\n- **Builds Understanding:** Each iteration helps MyCoder better understand your needs\n- **Focuses Feedback:** You can address specific aspects in each iteration\n- **Improves Quality:** Progressive refinement typically leads to better outcomes\n\n### Implementation Techniques\n\n1. **Start Simple:** Begin with a basic implementation\n2. **Provide Specific Feedback:** Focus on particular aspects to improve\n3. **Acknowledge Progress:** Recognize what's working well\n4. **Build on Success:** Use successful patterns as references for future work\n
