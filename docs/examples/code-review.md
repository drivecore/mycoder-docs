This page showcases real-world examples of effective prompts for these scenarios.\n\n## PR Review and Analysis\n\n### Example: Reviewing a PR for Potential Duplication\n\n```\nIn the current PR #45, which fixes issue #44 and it is also currently checked out as the current branch, there isn't duplication of the checks are there? In your writeup you say that \"added pre-push hook with the same validation\". It seems that we have both a pre-commit hook and a pre-push hook that do the same thing? Won't that slow things down?\n```\n\n**Why this works well:**\n- References a specific PR and issue\n- Quotes specific text from the PR description\n- Asks a focused question about a potential issue (duplication)\n- Expresses concern about a specific impact (performance slowdown)\n\n**Technique:** When reviewing PRs, asking MyCoder targeted questions about specific aspects helps surface potential issues that might not be immediately obvious.\n\n## Identifying Configuration Issues\n\n### Example: Reviewing Package Manager Configuration\n\n```\nI think that the github action workflows and maybe the docker build are still making assumptions about using npm rather than pnpm. Can you look at ../Business/drivecore/mycoder-websites as an example of docker files that use pnpm and also github action workflows that use pnpm and adapt the current project to use that style. Please create a github issue and then once the task is complete please submit a PR.\n```\n\n**Why this works well:**\n- Identifies a specific concern (npm vs. pnpm assumptions)\n- Points to a reference implementation with the desired approach\n- Clearly defines the expected deliverables (GitHub issue and PR)\n- Provides context about the current state and desired outcome\n\n**Technique:** Asking MyCoder to compare configurations across projects helps identify inconsistencies and standardize approaches.\n\n## UI and Design Review\n\n### Example: Requesting UI Improvements\n\n```\nCan you make the blue that is used for the links to be a little more dark-grey blue? And can you remove the underline from links by default? Please create a Github issue for this and a PR.\n```\n\n**Why this works well:**\n- Makes specific, focused requests for UI changes\n- Clearly describes the desired outcome\n- Specifies the process (create an issue and PR)\n\n**Technique:** For UI changes, being specific about the desired visual outcome helps MyCoder implement changes that match your expectations.\n
