# Code Development

MyCoder can assist with a wide range of code development tasks, from implementing new features to fixing bugs and improving existing code. This page showcases real-world examples of effective prompts for these scenarios.

## Implementing Feature Requests

### Example: Implementing Recommendations from an Issue

```
Can you implement the recommendations 2 and 3 from issue #44? You can look at the CI Github Actions workflow in ../mycoder-websites/.github as guide to setting up a similar CI action that validates the build and runs lint, etc for this repo.
```

**Why this works well:**
- References specific recommendations from an existing issue
- Points to an example implementation in another repository as a reference
- Clearly defines the scope (recommendations 2 and 3)
- Provides context about the expected outcome (CI action for build validation and linting)

**Technique:** Referencing existing issues and providing examples from other parts of the codebase helps MyCoder understand both the requirements and the implementation style.

## Architectural Changes and Refactoring

### Example: Refactoring an SDK Implementation

```
Recently this project was converted from using the Anthropic SDK directly to using the Vercel AI SDK. Since then it has created reliability problems. That change was made 4 days ago in this PR: https://github.com/drivecore/mycoder/pull/55/files

And it was built upon by adding support for ollama, grok/xai and openai in subsequent PRs. I would like to back out the adoption of the Vercel AI SDK, both the 'ai' npm library as well as the '@ai-sdk' npm libraries and thus also back out support for Ollama, OpenAI and Grok.

In the future I will add back these but the Vercel AI SDK is not working well. While we back this out I would like to, as we re-implement using the Anthropic SDK, I would like to keep some level of abstraction around the specific LLM.

Thus I would like to have our own Message type and it should have system, user, assistant, tool_use, tool_result sub-types with their respective fields. We can base it on the Vercel AI SDK. And then we should implement a generic generateText() type that takes messages and the tools and other standard LLM settings and returns a new set of messages - just as anthropic's SDK does.

We can have an Anthropic-specific function that takes the API key + the model and returns a generateText() function that meets the generic type. Thus we can isolate the Anthropic specific code from the rest of the application making it easier to support other models in the future.

The anthropic specific implementation of generateText will have to convert from the generic messages to anthropics specific type of messages and after text completion, it will need to convert back. This shouldn't be too involved.

We can skip token caching on the first go around, but lets create both an issue for this main conversion I've described as well as follow on issues to add token caching as well as OpenAI and Ollama support. You can check out old branches of the code here if that helps you analyze the code to understand.

I would like a plan of implementation as a comment on the first issue - the main conversion away from Vercel AI SDK.
```

**Why this works well:**
- Provides detailed background on the current implementation
- References specific PRs for context
- Clearly outlines the desired architecture with specific components
- Explains the rationale behind the changes
- Specifies what to include now vs. future additions
- Requests both implementation issues and a plan

**Technique:** For complex architectural changes, providing detailed context and a clear vision of the desired outcome helps MyCoder understand both the technical requirements and the reasoning behind them.

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Example: Investigating Build Configuration Issues

```
When I run this command \"pnpm --filter @web3dsurvey/api-server build\" in the current directory, it runs into an error because one of the packages in this mono-repo upon which @web3dsurvey/api-server is dependent is not built, but I am confused because I thought that pnpm would automatically build packages that are depended upon.

I must have some part of the configuration of the current project incorrect right? Can you create an issue for this and then investigate. You can use the command \"pnpm clean:dist\" to reset the package to its non-built state.
```

**Why this works well:**
- Describes the specific command that's failing
- Explains the expected behavior and the actual outcome
- Shares the developer's hypothesis about the cause
- Provides a command for reproducing the issue
- Asks for both an issue creation and an investigation

**Technique:** When troubleshooting, providing MyCoder with the exact commands, expected behavior, and reproduction steps helps it diagnose and fix the issue more effectively.

### Example: Investigating CI Failures

```
It seems that the latest GitHub action failed, can you investigate it and make a GitHub issue with the problem and then push a PR that fixes the issue? Please wait for the new GitHub action to complete before declaring success.
```

**Why this works well:**
- Identifies a specific problem (GitHub action failure)
- Requests a complete workflow: investigation, issue creation, and fix implementation
- Sets clear expectations for verification (waiting for the GitHub action to complete)

**Technique:** Asking MyCoder to handle the full cycle from investigation to fix helps ensure that the problem is properly understood and addressed.
