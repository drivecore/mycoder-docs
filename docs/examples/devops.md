This page showcases real-world examples of effective prompts for these scenarios.\n\n## CI/CD Configuration\n\n### Example: Setting Up GitHub Actions Workflows\n\n```\nCan you implement the recommendations 2 and 3 from issue #44. You can look at the CI Github Actions workflow in ../mycoder-websites/.github as guide to setting up a similar CI action that validates the build and runs lint, etc for this repo.\n```\n\n**Why this works well:**\n- References specific recommendations from an existing issue\n- Points to an example implementation in another repository\n- Clearly defines the expected outcome (CI action for build validation and linting)\n\n**Technique:** Providing reference implementations helps MyCoder understand your preferred approach to CI/CD configuration.\n\n## Package Manager Configuration\n\n### Example: Converting from npm to pnpm\n\n```\nI think that the github action workflows and maybe the docker build are still making assumptions about using npm rather than pnpm. Can you look at ../Business/drivecore/mycoder-websites as an example of docker files that use pnpm and also github action workflows that use pnpm and adapt the current project to use that style. Please create a github issue and then once the task is complete please submit a PR.\n```\n\n**Why this works well:**\n- Identifies a specific configuration issue (npm vs. pnpm)\n- Points to a reference implementation with the desired approach\n- Clearly defines the expected deliverables (GitHub issue and PR)\n\n**Technique:** When migrating between different tools or approaches, providing MyCoder with examples of the target configuration helps ensure consistency.\n\n## Build Configuration Troubleshooting\n\n### Example: Investigating Mono-Repo Build Issues\n\n```\nWhen I run this command \"pnpm --filter @web3dsurvey/api-server build\" in the current directory, it runs into an error because one of the packages in this mono-repo upon which @web3dsurvey/api-server is dependent is not built, but I am confused because I thought that pnpm would automatically build packages that are depended upon.\n\nI must have some part of the configuration of the current project incorrect right? Can you create an issue for this and then investigate. You can use the command \"pnpm clean:dist\" to reset the package to its non-built state.\n```\n\n**Why this works well:**\n- Describes the specific command that's failing\n- Explains the expected behavior and the actual outcome\n- Shares the developer's hypothesis about the cause\n- Provides a command for reproducing the issue\n\n**Technique:** For build configuration issues, providing MyCoder with the exact commands and expected behavior helps it diagnose and fix configuration problems effectively.\n\n## Investigating CI/CD Failures\n\n### Example: Debugging GitHub Actions\n\n```\nIt seems that the latest GitHub action failed, can you investigate it and make a GitHub issue with the problem and then push a PR that fixes the issue? Please wait for the new GitHub action to complete before declaring success.\n```\n\n**Why this works well:**\n- Identifies a specific problem (GitHub action failure)\n- Requests a complete workflow: investigation, issue creation, and fix implementation\n- Sets clear expectations for verification\n\n**Technique:** Having MyCoder investigate CI failures helps identify and resolve configuration issues that might be complex or time-consuming to debug manually.\n
