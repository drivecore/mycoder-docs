These examples are based on actual prompts that have proven successful in various scenarios.\n\nExamples are organized into categories to help you find relevant patterns for your specific needs.\n\n## Why Examples Matter\n\nSeeing how others effectively use MyCoder can help you:\n\n- Learn optimal prompt structures\n- Discover patterns for complex tasks\n- Understand how to break down problems\n- Improve your interaction efficiency\n\n## Using GitHub as External Memory\n\nOne key insight for getting the best results from MyCoder is using GitHub as a record of tasks and results. This serves as a persistent external memory store, allowing MyCoder to:\n\n- Reference previous work and decisions\n- Track the evolution of a project\n- Maintain context across multiple sessions\n- Build upon previous tasks systematically\n\nMany of the examples in this section demonstrate this approach in action.\n\n## Example Categories\n\n- [**GitHub Mode as a Productivity Multiplier**](./github-productivity.md) - How using GitHub as external memory transforms MyCoder into a true team member\n- [**Project Management**](./project-management.md) - Using MyCoder for planning, issue creation, and project organization\n- [**Code Development**](./code-development.md) - Examples of implementing features, fixing bugs, and writing tests\n- [**Code Review and Analysis**](./code-review.md) - Using MyCoder to review PRs, analyze code quality, and suggest improvements\n- [**DevOps and Configuration**](./devops.md) - Setting up CI/CD, Docker configurations, and environment management\n
