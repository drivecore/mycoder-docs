# MyCoder Examples

This section contains real-world examples of how to use MyCoder effectively. These examples are based on actual prompts that have proven successful in various scenarios.

Examples are organized into categories to help you find relevant patterns for your specific needs.

## Why Examples Matter

Seeing how others effectively use MyCoder can help you:

- Learn optimal prompt structures
- Discover patterns for complex tasks
- Understand how to break down problems
- Improve your interaction efficiency

## Using GitHub as External Memory

One key insight for getting the best results from MyCoder is using GitHub as a record of tasks and results. This serves as a persistent external memory store, allowing MyCoder to:

- Reference previous work and decisions
- Track the evolution of a project
- Maintain context across multiple sessions
- Build upon previous tasks systematically

Many of the examples in this section demonstrate this approach in action.
